# Preflow-Push
 The program implements the Preflow-Push algorithm for maximum flow in flow networks. It reads graph data from files, initializes flow and capacity matrices, manages node properties for flow distribution, and computes maximum flows using methods like preflowPush, push, and relabel. Results are printed for each graph processed from the input file.
